This project aims to develop a reinforcement learning trading bot to autonomously predict future fluctuations in stock price for S&P 500 companies. Through the use of historical data, our bot will refine its strategy for optimal performance.
Traditional trading bots created with LSTMs are short-term focused and less effective in a rapidly changing market, whereas our bot will adapt to changing conditions and learn from its trading experiences. Our reinforced learning approach will address the limitations of LSTM bots and optimize for a long-term reward.

Prior to running the code, make sure to have installed relevent dependencies.

To train, run training.py with the data of your choice. To test your model, run test.py with the model of your choice on the data of your choice.
